    <h1>About The Drink</h1>
    <p>It was invented in 2011 by bartender Joaquín Simó while working at the bar Death and Co in New York City. He is said to have claimed that this drink is the “bastard love child” of the Last Word and the Paper Plane.</p>
    <p>I think that this is the perfect cocktail. It has a perfect balance of sweet, sour, smoke, and herbaciousness. </p>
